- When submitting the review;
  - If the learner has satisfied all the requirements of the assignment, please 'APPROVE' the changes.
  - If the learner has not satisfied all the requirements of the assignment (for example if a Question is unanswered or not answered to the required degree of quality) and further changes are required for completion, please 'COMMENT' on the changes.
  
- Close the Pull Request. (Yes, even if further changes are required. The learner will submit those via a new pull request)

Thank you!
