# 1 Million Women To Tech (1MWTT)

## Submitting assignments for SOC2018 #HOWTO

* Click on the respective week's assignment link and accept the assignment

* Wait for a couple of minutes - a new branch called 'develop' should appear. Do your work in this branch

(Note: We are currently fixing an issue regarding our Github Bot and the Github API, once it is resolved you should be able to work in your own fork)

* When you are ready to submit, create a pull request from the *develop* branch into the *master* branch.

* A 'to-review' tag will be added to the repo, letting us know that your homework is ready to be corrected.

Note: If the 'develop' branch is not created within an hour or the 'to-review' tag does not appear after submission then please contact support. Remember to refresh the page a few times first.
