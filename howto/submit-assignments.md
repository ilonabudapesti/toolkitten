# 1 Million Women To Tech (1MWTT)

## Submitting assignments for SOC2018 #HOWTO

* Click on the respective week's assignment link and accept the assignment

* Wait for a couple of minutes - a new branch called 'develop' should appear. Do your work in this branch

* When you are ready to submit, create a pull request from the *develop* branch into the *master* branch.

* A 'to-review' tag will be added to the repo, letting us know that your homework is ready to be corrected.


> Notes: 
> - We are currently fixing an issue regarding our Github Bot and the Github API, once it is resolved you should be able to work in your own fork
> - Sometimes there may be issues during branch creation, especially if there was an error or hold up during the creation of the repo by Github Classrooms. If the 'develop' branch does not appear within 15 minutes, please create and work on your own branch.
> - If you face issues in committing directly to the 'master' branch, do not worry, this is to be expected. The bot protects the master branch to help trigger assignment events in the future. Please work on the 'develop' branch.
> - Please avoid creating pull requests if you are not done with the assignment. We understand that it is an integral part of the Github workflow and we apologise for the inconvenience, but out bot tracks it as an assignment submission. Once we sort out the issue regarding forks, you should be able to take full advantage of Github's workflow in your own fork. (You won't be penalised in any way for this - it just makes our job a bit harder to find assignments which need to be corrected)
> - If the 'to-review' tag does not appear after submission then please contact support. Remember to refresh the page a few times first.*
